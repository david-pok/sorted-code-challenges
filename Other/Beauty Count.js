// When John was a little kid he didn't have much to do.
// There was no internet, no Facebook, and no programs
// to hack on. So he did the only thing he could… he
// evaluated the beauty of strings in a quest to discover
// the most beautiful string in the world.
// Given a string s, little Johnny defined the beauty
// of the string as the sum of the beauty of the letters in it.
// The beauty of each letter is an integer between
// 1 and 26, inclusive, and no two letters have the
// same beauty. Johnny doesn't care about whether
// letters are uppercase or lowercase, so that doesn't
// affect the beauty of a letter. (Uppercase 'F' is
// exactly as beautiful as lowercase 'f', for example.)
// You're a student writing a report on the youth of this
// famous hacker. You found the string that Johnny
// considered most beautiful. What is the maximum
// possible beauty of this string?

// Input
// The input file consists of a single integer m followed
// by m lines.

// Output
// Your output should consist of, for each test case, a
// line containing the string "Case #x: y" where x is the
// case number (with 1 being the first case in the
//     input file, 2 being the second, etc.) and y
//     is the maximum beauty for that test case.

// Constraints
// 5 ≤ m ≤ 50
// 2 ≤ length of s ≤ 500

// Sample Input
// 5
// ABbCcc
// Good luck in the Facebook Hacker Cup this year!
// Ignore punctuation, please 🙂
// Sometimes test cases are hard to make up.
// So I just go consult Professor Dalves

// Sample Output
// Case #1: 152
// Case #2: 754
// Case #3: 491
// Case #4: 729
// Case #5: 646

const BeautyCount = (input) => {
    //check input and break down into separate strings if not already
    //run through each individual strings
    //check if ascii character is a letter
    //if it is a letter keep a count on how many times each char shows up
    //once done sort in descending with largest number getting their count
    //multiplied by 26, 2nd by 25, 3rd by 24, etc
    //tally up totals and return per string
